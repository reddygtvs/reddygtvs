# About Me

### Summary

I'm a software engineer building full-stack applications with **rapidly advancing AI capabilities** and modern web development. I like to build tools for designers and developers, thinking deeply about how interfaces look, feel, and behave.

When I'm not coding, I'm behind the camera doing photography or on the tennis court.

Previously, I worked as a frontend engineer and on applied AI research with Large Language Models.
